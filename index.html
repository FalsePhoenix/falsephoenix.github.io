        <h3 align="left">Democritus - (460 - 370 BCE) believed that such a thing as an atom existed and that along with the atoms there was “void”, empty space, which was everywhere an atom wasn’t.
            These two he theorized made up the entire physical world. He had made this theory on a commonly postulated idea about how far one could divide a piece of sand. He thought that 
            there would eventually be a particle that would be indivisible, this object being the atom. Democritus came up with an idea that was revdloutinary for it’s time even if it wasn’t very accurate.</h3>

        <h3 align="left">John Dalton - (1804) Made the next major jump in the theory of the atom. He studied the weight, volumes, and masses of elements to come up with his Atomic theory. Dalton’s Atomic Theory stated that all matter was comprised of atoms, and all atoms of the same element had the same size, mass, and properties, different atoms could combine to form compounds, and cannot be further divided created, or destroyed. Despite the many accurate things that Dalton had theorized there were also many inaccuracies in his theory such as atoms not being able to be subdivided or that all atoms of the same type have the same size and mass.</h3>

        <h3 align="left">J.J. Thomson - (1897) J.J. Thomsons Model was the first model to give an idea of how the atom worked. Thomson theorized that electrons in an atom worked similarly to how blueberries work with a muffin. In the model, the electrons were in the pudding and as they made their way to the outside of the atom the pull would become stronger and the electrons would be pulled back toward the center of the atom. His model while crude and basic was a start and paved the way for more advanced and accurate models that would later come down the road.</h3>

        <h3 align="left">Ernest Rutherford - (1911) Ernest Rutherford performed a now very famous experiment known as the gold foil experiment. In this experiment, Rutherford uses “alpha particles” that were admitted from a radioactive element and then directed at a thin piece of gold foil. Based on prior knowledge of the atom rutherford and the company assumed that all the alpha particles would pass through the gold foil. However, they observed that around 1 in 8000 of those particles was deflected in random directions off the gold foil. This observation allowed him to predict that within the atom most of the mass and all of the positive charge was held in one condensed area called the nucleus. Despite huge steps when it came to understanding the atom with the discovery of the nucleus it would still be many years until the electron would be included in the model.

            <h3 align="left"> Niels Bohr - (1913) Niel Bohr believed that electrons rather than emitting energy floating around at random around the nucleus existed within a constant state of energy. This idea went further in explaining how electrons could move from these stationary levels by either gaining or losing energy. This model served as the first idea of how electrons are related to the nucleus of the atom and allowed for many future advancements in the idea even if his first model wasn’t completely accurate with all atoms.

            <h3 align="left"> Erwin Schrodinger - (1926) Erwin Schrodinger created and solved a mathematical equation that proved an idea that was only assumed in Bohr's model. While Bohr predicted that the electrons moved around the nucleus in clean circular orbits it was found within Schrodinger’s equation that rather than following the exact path the electrons would rather be found anywhere within that electron cloud. His equation showed that it was only possible to show where there was a higher or lower probability of finding an electron within a field and that it was not possible to find the exact location of an electron.

            <h3 align="left">James Chadwick (1932) James Chadwick who worked under Rutherford played a major part in the discovery of the neutron. James Chadwick discover that by bombarding elements with helium particles that contained a strong positive charge. A relatively large particle would result from the reaction. Through measuring velocities, Chadwick was able to prove that these particles had nearly the same mass as a proton but with no charge. He called this particle the neutron and it played a large part in finalizing the atomic model.
